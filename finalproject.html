    <h3>Hi! We're Dami and Elisha, here's the story about how our project came to be:</h3>
    
    <br>

    <p>Behind every project, there's a story. Ours starts from a group of 4 reduced to 2, with busy schedules our project suffered from lack of planning. We both braced up and decided to give it our best. We had 48 hours to put something together as a pair and whilst we couldn't do anything majorly fancy, we really wanted to take the time to thank the instructors for what we have learnt. Neither of us had any coding experience at all prior to this programme, but thanks to these sessions we've learnt a lot of basic skills, created this imperfect website and we're so grateful for the knowledge acquired. We are very much grateful to go through this class with everyone. Thank you all for coming on this 8 week journey with us! </p>
